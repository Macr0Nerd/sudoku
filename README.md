# Sudoku
Sudoku is a puzzle game that is beloved by all and butchered by me. 
I only built this to practice my C++ and it turned out half decent.
Maybe I'll build a solver once I get decent at C++.

## How to Run
### Windows
1. Install g++
2. Navigate to the directory the files are in
3. Run `g++ -c main.cpp`
4. Confirm that the "main.o" file has been made
5. Run `g++ -o game main.o mastermind.cpp`
6. You can now play the game with `./game`
### Mac Os
1. Follow [this](https://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html)
### Linux
1. Install g++
2. Navigate to the directory the files are in
3. Run `g++ -c main.cpp`
4. Confirm that the "main.o" file has been made
5. Run `g++ -o game main.o mastermind.cpp`
6. You can now play the game with `./game`

## How to Play
You type in the row and column index and then what you want to place.
Continue to play exactly like sudoku.

Have fun.
